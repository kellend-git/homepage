This repo hosts the source code for my personal homepage, which you can find at http://www.kellendonohue.com.

Architecture-wise the homepage is a simple HTML5/CSS static page, with a tiny bit of JS for Google Analytics. It utilizes responsive CSS to be mobile-friendly. The website is deployed on Google App Engine.

Besides the resources for the homepage (including my resume) there is code for toy webapps I was creating and configuration for the Google App Engine deployment.
