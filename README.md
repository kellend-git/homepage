This repo hosts the source code for my personal homepage, which you can find at kellendonohue.com.

Architecture-wise the homepage is a simple HTML5/CSS static page, with a tiny bit of JS for Google Analytics. It utilizes responsive CSS to be somewhat mobile friendly. The website is deployed on Google App Engine. 

Besides the resources for the homepage (including my resume) there is code for toy webapps I was creating and configuration for the Google App Engine deployment.
